<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>This guide is a starting point for anyone that is wishing to
help improve the chipKIT-core API’s.  That is to say, fix bugs, add features or
help make the core more compatible with the Arduino/Wiring API.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although one of the primary goals of both Arduino and
chipKIT is to make getting started with embedded development as easy as
possible. If you are new to core hacking then you are in for a bit of a
learning curve.  If you want to know more about the history of chipKIT and
chipKIT-core skip to the end of this document.  If you are ready to for core
hacking then let’s get started.</p>

<h1>Folders: Arduino (Sketchbooks), libraries and hardware</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Knowing where various files are intended to be stored within
the Arduino IDE is crucial for successful core hacking.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If you have made it this far you probably already know the
following: within the Ardunio IDE when a user writes a program targeted for an
embedded development platform these programs are called sketches. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Sketches are stored in a folder called the “sketchbook”.  The
default sketchbook folder name is “Arduino”.  In windows this folder is created
in the users “Documents” folder the first time the Arduino IDE is run.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Although not needed for core hacking it’s good to know that the default
“sketchbook” folder can be changed from the Arduino IDE preferences dialog box. 
The preferences dialog box is accessible from the File menu in the Arduino IDE.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Sketches can use “libraries” that provide additional canned
functionality for your programs.  Libraries can come from at least three
different locations.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Built in libraries that are part of the Arduino IDE.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Libraries that are part of a specific core.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>User (aka contributed) libraries that are stored in the
“libraries” folder within the “sketchbook” folder.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Additional cores can be added to the IDE by adding a links to the
“Additional Boards Manager URL’s” in the preference dialog box as described <a
href="https://quick240.com/quicki/_media/chipkit:installing_and_using_the_arduino_ide_development_tool.pdf">here</a>. 
The additional cores are added into the “hardware” folder of for the IDE which
is NOT to be confused with the following:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The “Sketchbook” folder can have a sub folder called “hardware”
that is used give the IDE access to compiler and APIs not accessible in the
default download of the IDE.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Whenever you make a change to any of these folders are where the
IDE is looking for them you need to restart the IDE, it’s just not that smart.</p>

<h1>How to install chipKIT-core</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>The <a
href="http://chipkit.net/wiki/index.php?title=ChipKIT_core">chipKIT wiki</a>
describes two ways to install a chipKIT-core.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Auto
install via URL from within Arduino IDE</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Manual
install by copying ZIP file</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The auto install will put the chipKIT-core into a place that
is hidden from you but accessible by the Arduino IDE.  On my computer, it puts
it here: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>C:\Users\Jacob Christ\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The manual installation is better for hacking since it gets
put into the “sketchbook” folder …/Arduino/hardware/ but for best results I
recommend linking the git chipKIT-core repo to this directory as explained
below.</p>

<h1>The chipKIT-core Repository</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>The chipKIT-core repository is maintained in a git repository
on github located here: <a href="https://github.com/chipKIT32/chipKIT-core">https://github.com/chipKIT32/chipKIT-core</a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>WHEN YOU FETCH DON’T FOR GET TO UPDATE YOUR SUBMODULES!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can download, hack and contribute to the repository
without using git, but if you plan on doing a lot of work on the repo or any
other programming for that matter then it’s time to learn git.  Learning and
using git is outside the scope of this document but there is plenty of
information on how to use it out there.</p>

<h1>…\chipKIT-core\</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once you have cloned the repo you will have a “chipKIT-core”
folder (unless you renamed it).  Inside this folder you have the following
folders:</p>

<h2>…\chipKIT-core\ant-chipkittagversion\</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Source code for tool used by ANT for extracting git tags out
of the repo when building the core. </p>

<h2>…\chipKIT-core\antlib\</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Java jar files used by ANT when building the core. </p>

<h2>…\chipKIT-core\dist\</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Created by ANT when the project is built.</p>

<h2>…\chipKIT-core\docs\</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>github.io chipKIT-core documentation web site.</p>

<h2>…\chipKIT-core\modules\</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Location of the pic32prog programming tool</p>

<h2>…\chipKIT-core\pic32\</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is where the chipKIT-core Wiring API’s live.</p>

<h2>…\ chipKIT-core\tests\</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>A smattering test files.</p>

<h2>…\ chipKIT-core\build.xml</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Used by ANT to create the chipKIT-core distributions.  Try
“ant build help” for a list of possible targets.</p>

<h2>…\ chipKIT-core\build_instructions.txt</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reminders to the developers on how to build the
distribution.</p>

<h2>…\ chipKIT-core\LICENSE</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The chipKIT-core license file.</p>

<h2>…\ chipKIT-core\package_chipkit_index.json</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>A publicly visible json file that tells the Arduino IDE how
to install specific versions of chipKIT-core.</p>

<h2>…\ chipKIT-core\README.md</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The chipKIT-core license file</p>

<h2>…\ chipKIT-core\version.properties</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not sure what this file is for, I think it’s used by ANT</p>

<h1>How I Hack chipKIT-core (in Windows)</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>When I’m hacking the core, I’m doing it with the sole
intention of making it better for myself and the community.  Because of this I
want to make it very easy for me to get my changes pushed back up to github so
that I can make a pull request.  Some might suggest modifying the files in your
installed version of the core then copying them back to your cloned repo when
you are ready to commit.  I’m a bit lazier and prefer to operate directly on
the core itself.  Basically, it works like this.  Clone chipKIT core into its
own directory.  Then create a symbolic directory link from your hardware folder
in your sketchbook directory to the chipKIT-core repository.  The hardware folder
(in the sketch folder) is there to house custom cores for non-Arduino boards
that provide the compilers and libraries necessary to compile your sketch (such
at chipKITE-core).  Build a distribution of the core in the chipKIT-core
repository then copy compiler and tools directory from the build distribution
back down to the pic32 directory in the chipKIT-core repo.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here is how I accomplished this in windows:</p>

<h1>Installing ANT</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>The previous section mentioned using ANT to build the
distribution.  Instructions for installing ANT can be found here:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a href="http://ant.apache.org/">http://ant.apache.org/</a></p>

<h1>History</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>In an effort to make this documentation better, I’ve decided
to move some of the previous introduction (which is mostly history) to the end
of the document.  The thought being is that if you are looking to hack the core
the history may only slow your efforts.</p>

<h2>What is chipKIT</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The chipKIT project started as fork of the Arduino IDE, plus
its Wiring API as implemented for the Atmel AVR, with the express goal of
making the tools work with the Microchip PIC32 microcontroller.  Although the
project started with the Microchip PIC32, the ultimate goal was to allow the
growing number of people familiar with the Wiring API to use any
microcontroller they wanted with a “Multi-Platform” IDE.  The forked Arduino
IDE was renamed to MPIDE for Multi-Platform IDE and initially supported both Atmel
AVR and Microchip PIC32 devices.</p>

<h2>Sketches</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Within the Ardunio IDE, when a user writes a program
targeted for an embedded development platform these programs are called
sketches. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The concept of a program as a sketch is trying to make the
analogy of sketches in an artist’s sketch book.</p>

<h2>MPIDE is dead, long live MPIDE</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the Arduino community to expand their offerings to
include the Arduino Due which was implemented with an Atmel SAM ARM processors
they needed to change the Arduino IDE to support this new architecture.  This
was accomplished by pulling changes from MPIDE back into the Arudino IDE. 
Around version 1.6.5 of the Arduino IDE became the multi-platform IDE that
MPIDE had always yearned to be.  With this the chipKIT team dropped further
MPIDE development in favor turning the ported PIC32 libraries into what is
known at the chipKIT-core.  The chipKIT-core can now be installed within the
Arduino IDE Boards manager like many other cores for other boards and processor
types.</p>

<h2>Cores</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Starting around version 1.6 of the Arduino IDE features were
added to that allowed swapping out different compliers and libraries so that
the IDE can support the variety of different microcontrollers that have sprung
up around the Arduino community.  The files that are brought in to support
these boards are called “cores”.</p>

<h2>chipKIT-core</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The chipKIT-core project as it exists on github consists of
the implementation of the Arduino/Wiring API as implemented for the Microchip
PIC32 Microcontrollers.  The core consists of the PIC32 gcc cross complier,
PIC32 programming tools (picprog32), USB Drivers and Java/ANT build scripts. 
The Java/ANT build scripts allow for distributions to be built for multiple
platforms including Windows, Mac OSX, Linux and Arm processors (Such as the
RaspPI).  The chipKIT-core at best is very useful in getting a PIC32 processor
to do you bidding, at its worse its incomplete and needs help to improve it.</p>
